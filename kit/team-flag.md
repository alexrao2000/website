The Team Flag is used for indicating robot status and alliance. The center dome will light up either Blue or Yellow during the competition to indicate robot on Blue or Gold alliance. The Team Flag also has 4 red programmable LEDs that can be used to indicate the status of the robot in student code.

##Using the status LED

The simplest implementation of the status LED is to toggle LED on or off when a specified sensor returns value over or under a threshold. You can implement this functionality on your student code by checking sensor value and setting LED to be High or Low depending on a threshold value. Other suggested use cases are:

* To indicate autonomous code stages
* To debug student code
* To show off your creative pattern of LED light show
