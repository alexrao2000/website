<h2>I missed infosession! Is it too late?</h2>
Absolutely not! You can see <a href="../assets/faq/fall-infosession-2016.pdf">the slides from our infosession here</a>, and read through this page for some basic info about Pioneers in Engineering.
<h2>What does PiE do again?</h2>
Our keystone program is an 8 week robotics competition in the spring, held for local Bay Area high school students. We hope to expose students to hands-on robotics opportunities and encourage them towards higher education in STEM.
<h2>What do I get out of joining PiE?</h2>
We have a lot of opportunities for you to learn new technical skills and gain hands-on experience in a variety of fields. PiE is also a great place for professional development - alumni have gone on to distinguished graduate schools and work for top companies across the country. We're also a social group, with biannual retreats and banquets and near-weekly board game nights and late-night dinner runs.
<h2>How do I join? Do I have to apply?</h2>
There is no application to get involved with Pioneers in Engineering. We do have a few forms for you to fill out, which you can <a href="{{ "/get-involved/forms.html" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">view here</a>. However, these forms are not an application - they're for you to set up your PiE account and start doing cool stuff with us! You can drop off these forms at one of our worksessions, or pick up pre-printed copies there.
<h2>Do I have to be an engineering major to join?</h2>
Nope! Plenty of PiE staff are non-engineers - we have Computer Science majors, Cognitive Science majors, Biology majors, Econ majors, and more! We encourage people to explore projects that aren't necessarily related to their field of study.
<h2>When does PiE meet?</h2>
Our worksessions are every Wednesday from 7 - 9 PM and every Saturday from 1 - 3 PM. We meet in O'Brien Hall - typically in 212 O'Brien or the Breezeway. You can also frequently find us in our clubroom, 101 O'Brien, whether or not we have worksession. 101 can be a little tricky to find the first time around - let us know if you need help!
